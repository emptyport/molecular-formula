A simple library to work with molecular formula.

View on npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/molecular-formula).


## Installation
npm install molecular-formula --save

## Usage
#### Creating a new molecular formula and accessing the formula
To use this module, import it and then create a new molecular formula.
``` javascript
var molFormula = require('molecular-formula');
var water = new molFormula('H2O');
```

Subscripts are also now supported thanks to [AprilArcus](https://github.com/AprilArcus)!
``` javascript
var water = new molFormula('H‚ÇÇO');
```

You can retrieve the original formula like so.
``` javascript
var original_formula = water.getFormula();
```

You also have access to the elemental composition.
``` javascript
var composition = water.getComposition();
```

Output:
```
{
  H: 2,
  O: 1
}
```
Creating formula with parantheses is also supported.
``` javascript
var ammonium_phosphate = new molFormula('(NH4)3PO4');
```
There is a method for providing the simplified, condensed molecular formula in cases like this.
``` javascript
var simplified_formula = ammonium_phosphate.getSimplifiedFormula();
```
Output:
```
N3H12PO4
```
This can be useful in cases where perhaps you have a carbon chain where all the components are kept separate (e.g. CH3(CH2)4CH2OH).

#### Adding and subtracting elements
You also have the ability to add and subtract elements from the formula with the ```add``` and ```subtract``` functions. You can pass in either a string representation of what you want to add or a JSON object.

Example usage:
``` javascript
ammonium_phosphate.add('NaCl');
ammonium_phosphate.getSimplifiedFormula();
// This will give you N3H12PO4NaCl
ammonium_phosphate.subtract({ 'Na': 1, 'Cl': 1 });
ammonium_phosphate.getSimplifiedFormula();
// This will give you N3H12PO4 again
```

*Please note that once you add or subtract elements, the getFormula() function will return the same thing as the getSimplifiedFormula() function.*

#### Molecular mass
You can retrieve the molecular mass of a formula by using the ```getMass()``` function.

Example usage:
``` javascript
water.getMass();
// This gives 18.01528
```

## Tests
You can run `npm test` to run the tests after installing the development dependencies.

## Future functionality
There are currently no planned improvements to this module. I am open to suggestions so let me know if you think something is missing.
